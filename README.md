MUlti SImilarity CALCulation

# Description: #
Just a simple tool to calculate tanimoto similarity values using multiple types of fingerprints. Current version: morgan, rdkit, and maccs. Outputs a table (.txt) with molecules from query file, molecules from dataset file, and similarity values. Need to run the script in a folder with two .smi files: one for the query and one for the dataset. Useful to make a fast pair-match similarity comparison, or to further use the outputted table for chemical diversity analysis.

# Place in folder: #
* musicalc.py 
* query.smi
* dataset.smi
